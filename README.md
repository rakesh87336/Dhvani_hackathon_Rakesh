Dhvani Hackathon - Project README
Welcome to the Dhvani Hackathon project submission. This repository contains all code, reports, and resources for two main tasks:

A 3D Bee Path Plotter (differential equations simulation)

Vehicle Detection using YOLO (deep learning object detection)

A bonus: Defect Detection using Donut Defect Script

File Descriptions
3D Bee Path Plotter - Colab.pdf
Contains step-by-step instructions, code, and plots for simulating and visualizing a “bee’s path” in 3D space using differential equations (Python/Colab).

dhvani.docx
Main hackathon report. This document explains the problems addressed, methodology, experimental results, and conclusions for your submission.

donut_defect.py
Python script for detecting defects in donuts using image processing and/or machine learning methods. Run with Python and follow in-code comments for usage instructions.

g.png
Image file—most likely an output plot or graph (e.g., 3D bee trajectory from the simulation).

vehicle_detection.zip
A zipped folder containing everything needed for vehicle detection:

YOLO-formatted dataset (images + annotation labels)

Model training scripts

data.yaml config file for YOLO

Instructions for training and testing your own object detection model on vehicles

Instructions
For Bee Path Plotter
Open 3D Bee Path Plotter - Colab.pdf to follow the guide.

Alternatively, use the notebook/script (as found in dhvani.docx) to reproduce results.

For Vehicle Detection (YOLO)
Unzip vehicle_detection.zip.

Refer to included scripts and the data.yaml file.

Follow the steps as described in dhvani.docx to train, validate, and test the object detection model.

For Donut Defect Detection
Simply run donut_defect.py using Python.

Ensure any required input images or data are present as per script comments.

Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

Packages: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pandas, seaborn, xmltodict, ultralytics (YOLO)

For Colab users: follow pip installs as described in the scripts/reports

Notes
All code is provided with comments and documentation for clarity.

For additional details, explanations, and results, see dhvani.docx
